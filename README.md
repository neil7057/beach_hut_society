-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I've used the main colours 
        -   Some colours were muted or changed to meet WAVE guidelines during final stage testing. 
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The
        -   
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Each header
        -   
        -   The site has additional images where it adds clarity or is the best mechanism to communicate ideas.

    -   #### Design Considerations
        -   The header of each page
        -   
        -   Colours are 

        -   There are wider margins on each page in larger screen sizes as is common practice in web development. These margins reduce at smaller screen sizes. 

        -   The site is responsive with some items resized for smaller screens. 

        -   Menu navigation is consistent across all pages and screen sizes and is central to each page. 

        -   Menu button text is.

        -   There is a customised error-404 page 'just in case'.

        -   There is a confirmation popup when a form is successfully submitted and a corresponding popup if the form submission is unsuccessful. The popup is dismissed when 'close' is slected or the user clicks outside of the form. The logo on the popup form also directs back to the Home Page.

-   ### **Structure**

    The structure of the site is informed by the the target audience's expectations and the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was making everything as intuitive as I could. Each page has a clear function and is named to give a clear indication of content/function.

    The site has a simple structure made up of 4 pages:
    * Homepage - An introduction 
    * 
    *
    * Comments - A form to allow the user to send comments or requests for further information.

    * There is one additional sub page and a confirmation popup on sucessful/failed email sending:
        -   A Confirmation thank you popup for when a user has successfully submitted a form and an email has been sent. Alternatively, a Confirmation thank you popup with a link to send a direct email if the form submission fails.
        -   A 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existent page.

    The site has a navbar which remains central to the screen on desktop, tablet and mobile, this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and is suitable for a first time or returning visitor. The active button is a different shape to distinguish it. There is also a footer on every page with links to social media sites and the Comments page.

    Each page logo, except the Home Page itself, has a link back to Home. Each page has a scrolling 'top of page' anchor link.

    Social media links all point to the

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the website to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### HTML

This was carried out periodically as each page was created and amended and then finally checked again when pages were deemed complete and error free.

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 280px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on the following browsers:
- Chrome    (123.0.6312.106).
- Edge      (123.0.2420.81).
- Firefox   (124.0.2).
- Safari    (17.4).
- Opera     (109.0.5097.24).

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to
[vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv).
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect).
3. Set to responsive and decrease width in stages to 280px.
4. Set the zoom to 50%.
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width, noting transitions at breakpoints.
6. Rotate and test for portrait to landscape transition.

Results:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.
Text resizes as expected at breakpoints.
Some content is hidden where it would clutter smaller screens.

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- iPhone X, 12, 14.
- Apple iPad 12.9.
- Fujitsu 15.4in laptop.
- Hp 22in desktop.

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development
and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs.

- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in
  [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).    

- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user.

- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions.

- All non-textual content has alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers.

- HTML page lang attribute has been set.

- Aria properties have been implemented correctly.

- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed.

- Hyperlink text colour has been adjusted to adhere to contrast guidelines.

Results:

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="docs/testing/wave-index.jpg">

### Functional Testing

- ### Navigation Links

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design.
This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page on a desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile device.

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as expeccted. External content opens in a new page.

-   ###  Testing
Testing was performed to ensure that 

The form on the contact page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected when correct and incorrect data was input.

Specifically:

-   Missing one or more input field:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.

-   Incorrect email format:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.
    
-   Form completed correctly with valid information in all fields:
    The form is able to be submitted.

-   Form textarea will only accept a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 280 characters.

-   Succesful submission of the contacts/feedback form: A confirmation message is displayed. 

-   Incorrect submission was emulated by temporarily amending emailJS validation information to force an error. The "failed" confirmation message was displayed as expected and could be dismissed. 

- ### Links Testing

Testing was performed to:

-   Open each hyperlink on each page and check that it is a valid URL and opens in a new page.

-   Checked on desktop, tablet and mobile.

-   ### Footer Social Media Icons / Links

Testing was performed on the Font Awesome Social Media icons in the footer to ensure that each one opened in a new tab and that each one
had a 'grow' hover effect.

Each item opened a new tab when clicked as expected and correct hover effect was present.

-   ### Footer Contact Information

The 'go to' link reacts when hovered over.

### Further Testing

-   Testing was carried out as each function was developed. The menu structure, navigation and footer were tested until error free on index.html before propogating to other pages.
-   As each page was completed, existing succesful tests were rerun to ensure that proven functionality hadn't been affected. 
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7/8/X and iPad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Contact email Testing
-  A series of contact forms were successfully completed and emails sent. Emails were received into the webdev1961 gmail account:

-   The confirmation message is presented and disappears when clicked.
-   A forced error on emailJS produces the 'failed to send' message. It's possible to either close this or send a direct email from the link.
